Two-Campus Network Simulation (Cisco Packet Tracer)

This project simulates communication between two separate campuses using VLANs, routing, wireless access points, and multiple networking devices. It demonstrates how packets move across a structured network and how different devices communicate through routers and switches.

🔧 Features
