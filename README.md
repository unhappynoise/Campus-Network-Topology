Two-Campus Network Simulation (Packet Tracer)

This project simulates communication between two campuses using VLANs, routing, access points, and multiple networking devices.

Features:

VLAN configuration

Inter-VLAN routing

Switch-to-switch trunking

Router-on-a-stick

Packet transmission demonstration

Wireless + wired communication

Files Included:

School Campus.pkt – Full Packet Tracer topology

net_topology.png – Network diagram


What I Learned:

Troubleshooting routing issues

VLAN & IP design

Subnetting

How packets move across a multi-network environment
